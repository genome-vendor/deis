:title: Planning Process
:description: The open source planning process for the Deis project used to define the roadmap and its execution.

.. _planning:

Planning Process
================
Deis features a lightweight process that emphasizes openness and ensures every community member can be an integral part of planning for the future.

The Role of Maintainers
-----------------------
`Maintainers`_ lead the project. Their duties include proposing the Roadmap, reviewing and integrating contributions and maintaining the vision of the project.

Open Roadmap
------------
The :ref:`roadmap` is a community document. While Maintainers propose the Roadmap, it gets discussed and refined in Release Planning Meetings.

Contributing to the Roadmap
---------------------------
Proposals and issues can be opened by anyone. Every member of the :ref:`community` is welcome to participate in the discussion by providing feedback and/or offering counter-proposals.

Release Milestones
------------------
The Roadmap gets delivered progressively via the :ref:`release_schedule`.  Releases are defined during Release Planning Meetings and managed using GitHub Milestones which track specific deliverables and work-in-progress.

Release Planning Meetings
-------------------------
Major decisions affecting the Roadmap are discussed during Release Planning Meetings on the first Thursday of each month, aligned with the :ref:`release_schedule`.

Release Planning Meetings are open to the public with access coordinated via the #deis IRC channel on Freenode.
Notes from past meetings are below, along with links to a recording of the entire meeting on YouTube.

April 2016

February 2016
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There was no public release planning meeting for February.

January 2016 (Deis 1.x LTS release and Deis v2 Alpha)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We're still taking feedback and suggestions on what our users would like to
see in the 1.x LTS release. Feel free to provide your input on the
`LTS release issue`_ on GitHub.

Over the last month we've been hard at work on Deis v2 which puts the Deis
workflow people have come to know and love on top of the `Kubernetes`_ platform.
Aaron demoed what we've done so far with the release of Deis v2 Alpha.
(`v2 alpha walkthrough cheatsheet`_)

If you've tried out v2 alpha, let us know what you think via the
`v2 alpha feedback`_ GitHub issue!

You can also take a look at our `v2 beta milestone`_ goals and chime in there.

December 2015 (Deis 1.x LTS release)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While much of our engineering efforts have shifted to complete Deis v2,
we plan to ship one final release of the 1.x branch. This release will be
a long-term support (LTS) release, receiving bug fixes and security updates
for the foreseeable future.

We invite our community to help us plan this release, and look forward to your
comments in the `LTS release issue`_ on GitHub.
